<h1>The Best Movies According to James Kanyi</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Burn Notice</h3>
<p>Had a very exciting narration of events happening plus exhilarating action.</p>
<h3>The Blacklist</h3>
<p>I was glued to it due to the "rabbit out of a hat" moves of Reddington.</p>
<h3>Banshee</h3>
<p>The gore kind of scenes were frightening.</p>
